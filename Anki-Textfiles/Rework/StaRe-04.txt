"{{c1::Stratifying}} by category means to {{c2::fit a separate line/parameter}} for each category"

"{{c1::Causes}} are not in the data.
Therefore, firstly think about the {{c2::scientific}} model, only afterwards about the {{c2::statistical}} model"

"{{c1::Dummy}} variables tell category belonging via {{c2:: giving a boolean}} for each category"
;

"{{c1::Index}} variables tell category belonging via {{c2:: numbers pointing}} to one category"

"When comparing categories, you need to calculate the {{c1:: contrast}} between categories"
;

"You are {{c1::never}} legitimate to compare {{c2::overlaps}} of parameters!

This concretely means: I can not sensibly compare parameters via their {{c3::confidence intervals}} or {{c3::p-values}}!"
;

"The {{c1::contrast}} between categories is the {{c2::distribution of differences}} between categories"
;

"I can compute a contrast by using {{c1::posterior samples}} of the {{c2::category parameters}} in question"
;

"Inference with multi-variable linear models:

Either: {{c1::Compute}} each estimand
or: {{c1::Simulate}} each estimand as {{c2:: an intervention}}"

"Golden rule of categorical variable comparison:
I want the {{c1::mean difference}}, not the {{c1::difference of means}}"
;

"For statistical models which are {{c2::non-linear} and {{c2::made from linear parts}}, I can go for {{c1::Splines}} or (maybe...) {{c1::Polynomials}}"
